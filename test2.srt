62
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,990
别吐出来
Don't let it out.

63
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,030
差一点
I can't.

64
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,630
我没事
I'm okay.

65
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,660
你确定？

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
你打得很好

67
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,060
一旦你醒来

我没睡着
I wasn't sleeping.

69
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
不 不 不
No, no, no.

70
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,560
我来吧
I'll do it.

71
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,410
阿拉肯 北厄拉科斯星球首府

72
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,260
拉 拉班大人

73
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,730
现在香料田已经安全了
Now that the spice field are secured,

74
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,660
我强烈建议将所有军队

75
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,760
撤出弗雷曼人的区域
out of Fremen territories.

76
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,160
我们在沙漠里损失了太多人
We're losing too many men to the desert

77
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,730
老鼠
Rats.

78
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,130
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

79
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,230
我们损失的人……
We're losing them...

80
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,630
给了老鼠
To rats.

81
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,890
弗雷曼人
Fremen.

82
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,790
我无法确认 大人
I can't confirm, my Lord.

83
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,460
在开阔的沙地上通讯很混乱
Communications are hectic in the open sands.

84
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,890
你的任务
Your orders,

85
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
是控制整个星球
were too control the whole the planet.

86

我们有……
We have–

87

这只是一半
That's only half of it.

88
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,990
你可能还记得 南方不适合居住 大人
As you may recall, the south is uninhabtable, my Lord

89
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,560
我建议你休息一下 好吗？
May I suggest you get some rest?

90
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:53,730
老鼠！
Rats!

91
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,360
杀光他们！
Kill them all!

92
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
杀光他们！
Kill them all!

93
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,660
老鼠！
Rats!

94
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,560
他问我们为什么迟到了
He's asking why we're so late.

95
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
他认为你们是间谍
He thinks you're spies.

96
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,260
这里不欢迎你们

97
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,660
他说……
He said...

98
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,670
我听懂了

99
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,060
谢谢

100
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,090
跟紧我
Stay close to me.

101
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,730
塔布尔穴地
Sietch Tabr

102
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,610
詹米! 詹米！

103
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,080
你杀了詹米！

104
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,380
间谍！

105
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,080
女巫！

106
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,470
住手! 住手！

107
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,040
他们不知道自己在说什么

108
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,640
李桑·阿尔-盖布! 李桑·阿尔-盖布！

109
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,080
救世主！

110
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,320
我需要你指引我们怎么处理那两个外国人

111
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,660
把他们交给沙漠

112
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,630
我看到了征兆

113
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,300
又来了

114
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,500
斯第尔格 你的信仰蒙蔽了你的双眼

115
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,410
李桑·阿尔-盖布还没出世呢！

116
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,050
他在一场公平的决斗中战胜了詹米

117
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,290
他会说我们的语言

118
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,920
他很快就会学会我们的生存之道

119
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,690
我愿意为他献出生命

120
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,330
沙漠将决定他的命运

121
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,270
那个女人呢？

122
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,730
看来贝尼·杰瑟里特的宣传已经深入人心
Looks like the Bene Gesserit's ' propaganda has taken root

123
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,820
有些人已经认为我是他们的救世主了
Some of them already think I'm their messiah.

124
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,130
其他人 则认为我是假先知
Others, false prophet.

125
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,460
我必须说服那些不信的人
I must sway the non-believers.

126
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,990
如果他们跟着我 我们就可以
If they follow me, we can

127
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,060
破坏香料生产
disrupt spice production.

128
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,430
只有这条路我才能接近皇帝
That's the only way I can get to the emperor.

129
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,890
你父亲不相信复仇
Your father didn't believe in revenge.

130
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,960
我相信
Hell, I do.

131
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,260
怎么了？
What is happening?

132
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
外国人吃不了辣？

133
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,360
怎么回事？
What is it?

134
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,230
食物里有香料
There's spice in the food.

135
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,220
他蓝眼睛一定很好看

136
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,360
别嘲笑他

137
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,490
他值得我们尊重 他是个好战士

138
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,590
女人 跟我来
Woman, come with me.

139
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,400
放回井里 我们的水回来了

140
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,770
我们祝福我们的兄弟 詹米

141
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,660
三千八百万公升
38 million decaliters.

142
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,160
我们即使渴死
None of us, even dying of thirst

143
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,160
也不会喝这的水
would ever drink this water.

144
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,330
这是神圣的
This is sacred.

145
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,160
创世纪之水
Genesis water.

146
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,730
我们有几千个这样的地方
We have thousands of places.

147
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,960
我们有足够的水源
where we have enough water.

148
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,890
李桑·阿尔-盖布将会
The Lisan al-Gaib will

149
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,190
改变厄拉科斯星球的面貌
Change the face of Arrakis

150
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,930
它将使树木重生 它将使……
It will bring back trees, it will bring back...

151
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,790
绿色天堂重现
a green paradise.

152
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,330
这么多灵魂
So many souls

153
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
永远不要把你的水给别人
Never give your water away,

154
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,830
即使死人也不行
not even for the dead.

155
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,660
你为什么带我看这些？
Why are you showing me this?

156
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,490
因为你是贝尼·杰瑟里特
Because you are Bene Gesserit

157
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,760
因为你了解预言
Because you understand the prophecies.

158
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,930
李桑·阿尔-盖布的母亲
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib

159
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,860
会成为圣母
will be a Reverend mother.

160
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,690
我们的圣母快死了
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

161
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,190
你想让我代替她？
You want me to take her place?

162
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,790
是的
Yes,

163
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,590
我想
I do.

164
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,630
你相信保罗吗？
Do you believe in Paul?

165
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,490
有征兆
There are signs.

166
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,660
是的
Yes.

167
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,930
如果我拒绝呢？
What if I would refuse?

168
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,430
那他就不是李桑·阿尔-盖布
Then he is not Lisan al-Gaib,

169
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,160
你就没有任何意义了
And you have no purpose to serve.

170
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,990
那你还能做什么？
What else is left to do then?

171
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,330
把你的水放回井里？
But return your water to the well?

172
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,890
这是种荣誉 不是吗？
It's an honor, isn't it?

173
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,660
我觉得你应该感到荣幸
I think you should feel honored.

174
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,330
这是生死决择
It was a choice between this or death,

175
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,290
所以请原谅我的不敬
so forgive me if I'm not flattered.

176
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,660
一个人怎样才能当上圣母？
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

177
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,830
不同的文化是不同的
It's different from one culture to another.

178
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,660
在厄拉科斯星球 我不知道
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

179
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,830
你害怕了
You're afraid.

180
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,660
圣母肩负着
A Reverend Mother has the task

181
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,590
保存他们以前历代圣母的
of holding the memories

182
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,430
全部记忆的使命
of all the Reverend Mothers that came before them,

183
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,160
所以我会被赐予几个世纪的痛苦与悲伤
so I'll be given centuries of pain and sorrow.

184
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,930
危险吗？
Is it dangerous?

185
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,330
对男人来说是致命的
It's lethal for men.

186
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,190
绝对是
That's for sure.

187
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,590
你们在笑什么？
What are you guys laughing about?

188
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,160
别管了
Don't bother.

189
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,860
你不相信这一切？
You don't believe in all this?

190
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,860
不 我们不信
No, we don't.

191
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,930
这些都是南方的信仰
These are all Southern beliefs.

192
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,360
南方的信仰？
Southern beliefs?

193
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,730
南方部落相信弥赛亚
Southern tribes believe that a Messiah

194
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,190
会来拯救我们脱离邪恶
will come to deliver us from evil.

195
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,990
你不相信李桑·阿尔-盖布？
You don't believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

196
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,260
我们相信弗雷曼人
We believe in Fremen

197
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,830
阿门

198
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,660
你想控制别人？
You want to control people?

199
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,060
你告诉他们救世主会来
You tell them a Messiah will come.

200
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
然后他们会等上几个世纪
Then they'll wait, for centuries.

201
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,530
现在 我们必须祈祷
Now, we must pray.

202
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,560
他怎么了？
What about him?

203
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,730
斯第尔格？
Stilgar?

204
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,890
他是南方人
He's from the South.

205
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,760
你没注意到他的口音
You didn't notice his accent.

206
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,630
我妈妈会怎么样？
What'll happen to my mother?

207
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,150
她会喝沙虫的尿

208
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,550
一点都不好笑

209
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,220
他就要失去她了

210
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,150
如果她蠢到喝毒药的话

211
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,390
住口！住口！

212
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,030
我们在祈祷

213
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,680
这是生命之水

214
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,620
它能解放心灵

215
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,990
如果你喝的话

216
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,390
你就会死去

217
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,830
如果你喝的话

218
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,970
你可以看见

219
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,570
喝！

220
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,670
这是什么？

221
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,590
我们做了什么？

222
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,260
她怀孕了

223
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,670
那不是奇迹！

224
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,640
你亲眼看到的！

225
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,950
李桑·阿尔-盖布的母亲

226
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,910
将在神圣的毒药试炼中幸存

227
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,450
她做到了

228
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,180
像书上写的那样！

229
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,090
那是她的族人写的！

230
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,990
亵渎神明

231
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,730
预言已经实现了

232
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,530
救世主必须是弗雷曼人！

233
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,030
厄拉科斯必须由自己的人民来解放！

234
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,560
她说得对 她说得对
She's right.

235
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,680
这不是奇迹
It's no miracle.

236
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,070
我妈妈受过这方面的训练
My mother was trained to do that.

237
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,300
把毒素转化成别的东西
Poison transmutation is something

238
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,300
高级贝尼·杰瑟里特可以做到
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

239
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,300
我不是救世主
I'm not the Mahdi.

240
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,230
我不是来领导的
I'm not here to lead.

241
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,760
我是来学习你们的生存之道的

242
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,900
我在这里与你们并肩作战
I'm here to fight beside you.

243
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,800
这是我唯一的要求
That's all I'm asking.

244
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,750
我很谦虚地说他是救世主

245
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,020
更有理由相信他是！

246
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,820
像书上写的那样！

247
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,130
她怎么样？
How is she?

248
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,130
她很害怕 但她没事
She was frightened but she's okay.

249
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,130
她跟我说话
She talks to me.

250
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,030
她相信你
She believes in you.

251
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,400
她说
She says

252
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,830
魁萨茨·哈德拉克给我们指明道路

253
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
你就快成功了
You're so close now.

254
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,300
只有一步之遥
Only one step remains.

255
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,700
你会成为魁萨茨·哈德拉克
you will become the Kwisatz Haderach.

256
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,170
只有一步之遥
Only one step remains.

257
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,470
你必须像我一样
You must do what I did.

258
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,830
你必须喝下生命之水
You must drink the water of life.

259
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,870
你会解放心灵 你将看见
Your mind is gonna open and you will see.

260
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,020
你将看见！

261
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,350
美丽与恐怖！

262
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
如果你想和我们并肩战斗
If you want to fight with us,

263
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,570
首先你必须学会
first thing you must learn

264
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,970
与沙漠融为一体
to be one with the desert.

265
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,870
这里有帐篷和足够的食物
So here is a tent and enough food.

266
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,400
我要你走到那个小沙丘 然后返回
I want you to cross that small erg and come back.

267
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:50,930
晚上回来
Come by night.

268
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,600
你知道怎么用指南针
You know how to use a paracompass.

269
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,030
会的
Yes.

270
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,970
还有什么我需要知道的吗？
Anything else I should know?

271
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,200
除了沙虫和哈克南人
Beside the worms and the Harkonnens,

272
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,070
小心土蜘蛛
beware of the trap door spiders.

273
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,570
蜈蚣也很讨厌
Centipedes are very nasty.

274
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,730
不是那些大的
Not the big ones.

275
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,000
大的无害
They are harmless.

276
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,170
但小的你就要注意了
But the little ones you have to worry about.

277
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,300
千万 千万别听巨灵的话
Don't ever, ever listen to the Djinn.

278
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,400
巨灵
The Djinn.

279
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,000
巨灵 沙漠之魂
Djinn, desert spirits.

280
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,270
他们在夜晚轻言细语
They whisper at night.

281
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,870
他们会魅惑你
They can possess you.

282
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,100
真的 小心点
Really, be careful.

283
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,030
他们是恶魔
They are demons.

284
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,670
但这是真的
But it's true.

285
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,530
别听他们的
Don't listen to them.

286
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,640
他不知道如何穿越沙地

287
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,440
斯第尔格会害死他的

288
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,810
他想证明什么？

289
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,080
你觉得呢？

290
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,120
“先知必知道沙漠的道路”

291
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,360
我觉得这样最好

292
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,700
是不是这样？

293
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,170
你现在关心他了？

294
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,400
他和其他陌生人不一样

295
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,940
他很真诚

296
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,670
詹米
Jamis

297
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,730
你走起路来像只喝醉的蜥蜴
You sand walk like a drunk lizard.

298
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,900
是么 目前为止我做得还不赖
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good so far.

299
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,080
我们还没进入沙虫的地盘呢
We're not even in worm territory yet.

300
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,900
你得打破你的节奏
You have to break up your rhythm.

301
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,170
像这样
Like this.

302
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,300
这很有趣 因为在胶片书里
Now that's interesting because in the film books

303
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,600
我研究过 人类学家说
I've studied, the anthropologists say in order

304
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,570
你必须按照一定的规律，才能在沙地上行走
to properly sand walk, you actually have to.

305
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,930
算了
Nevermind.

306
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,370
请继续
Please keep going.

307
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,530
你知道 我是唯一一个相信
You know, I'm the only one who believes

308
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,700
你会撑到夏天的人
you're gonna make it until summer.

309
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,600
如果你想在沙漠里跟上我们
If you wanna follow us in the desert,

310
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,970
你就得知道捕风器的原理
you need to know how wind traps work.

311
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,130
所以听我说
So listen to me.

312
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,730
我总是觉得很简单
It's always neat to me.

313
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,730
它们很简单 但需要时刻留意
They're simple, but they require constant attention.

314
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,670
啥？
What?

315
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,900
别这样看着我
Stop looking at me like that.

316
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,530
你说得对
You're right.

317
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,730
如果我们想保护你的哥哥
If we want to protect your brother,

318
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,130
我们需要所有弗雷曼人都相信预言
we need all the Fremen to believe in the prophecy.

319
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,300
我们必须一个接一个地改变不信者的信仰
We must convert the non-believers one by one.

320
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,130
我们得从弱者开始
We need to start with the weaker ones.

321
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,400
意志簿弱的人
the vulnerable ones.

322
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,700
那些害怕我们的人
The ones that fear us.

323
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,710
契妮！
Chani!

324
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,570
装弹
Reload.

325
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,820
装弹
Reload.

326
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,300
屏蔽场 只有直升机开火时才会关闭
The shield. They only open when they're firing.

327
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,900
我知道
I know that.

328
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,860
你以为我在做什么？
What do you think I'm trying to do?

329
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,760
我做引子
I'm triggering.

330
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,700
等我信号
On my signal.

331
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,630
准备
Be ready.

332
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,930
哦 该死
Oh shit.

333
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,970
你看到他做了什么

334
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,110
他早就料到了

335
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,310
他救了她的命

336
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,780
他看到了

337
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,650
他能预见

338
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,120
穆阿迪布喜欢他的味道

339
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,730
谁教你这样战斗的？
Who taught you to fight like that?

340
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,560
我以前的师傅
My old masters.

341
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,080
他们是很要好的朋友
And they were close friends.

342
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,060
他们被屠杀了 和我父亲一起
They were a massacred. Alongside my father.

343
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,650
你们与哈克南人作战几十年
You've been fighting The Harkonnens for decades.

344
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,030
我的家族已经与他们争斗了几个世纪
My family has been fighting them for centuries.

345
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,900
他们的习惯 他们的思维方式 我了如指掌
Their habits, their ways of thinking. I know everything about them,

346
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,760
你们对沙漠了如指掌
You know everything about the desert.

347
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,900
你们驾驭沙漠的力量
You harness the very power of it.

348
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
我们可以一起阻止他们
We can stop them together.

349
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,660
让他们死无丧身之沙
Bury them in the sand where they belong.

350
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,960
让这个星球再次属于你们
So that this planet can be yours once more.

351
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,260
你要我们做什么？
What will you have us do?

352
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,330
你会怎么做 斯第尔格？
What would you do, Stilgar?

353
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,960
我会挥戈北上
I would strike even further north.

354
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,060
那我挥戈北上
Then I will go further north.

355
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
你越往北走
The further north you go,

356
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,930
你越可能死
the more likely it is you die.

357
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,080
我会死

358
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,720
也许你也会死

359
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,750
但其他人会继续前进

360
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,760
直到弗雷曼人获得自由为止 否则他们是不会罢休的

361
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,730
他应该加入弗雷曼敢死队

362
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,270
他需要个名字 斯第尔格

363
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,740
好样的！好样的！

364
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,560
我在你身上看到了力量
I see strength in you.

365
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,440
像友索一样

366
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,080
意思是“梁柱的底座”

367
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
过来 过来
Come, come.

368
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,300
在我们中间 你应该被称为友索
You shall be known among us as Usul.

369
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,400
友索
Usul.

370
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,200
现在 你加入了弗雷曼敢死队 成为一名战士
And now a Fedaykin is a fighter.

371
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,730
你还必须选一个
and needs a war name.

372
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,730
战斗用的名字
You must choose.

373
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:43,130
你们怎么称呼这只沙漠小老鼠来着？
How do you call the small desert mouse again?

374
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,460
穆阿迪布 穆阿迪布
Muad'Dib.

375
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,230
不 不 不
No, no, no.

376
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,760
哦 不 穆阿迪布是很聪明的
Oh no, Muad'Dib is wise.

377
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,760
穆阿迪布深知沙漠的生存之道
Muad'dib is wise in the ways of the desert.

378
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,830
穆阿迪布 能自己制造水
Muad'Dib creates his own water.

379
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,060
能辩别指向北方的星座
The constellation that points to the North

380
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,560
所以我们叫它穆阿迪布
we call Muad'Dib.

381
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,100
指引方向的人
The one who points the way.

382
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,200
这名字很有力量
That is powerful name.

383
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,460
现在你是我们的兄弟了
Now you are our brother.

384
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,360
保罗·穆阿迪布·友索
Paul Muad'Dib Usul.

385
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,700
嘿! 斯第尔格！
Hey! Stilgar!

386
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,280
父亲 我找到了自己的路
Father, I found my way.

387
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,580
真美啊
It's breathtaking.

388
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,660
看 这就是香料
Look, right there's spice

389
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,560
每当夕阳落暮的时候 厄拉科斯星球格外动人
Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low.

390
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,730
在你的家乡
Where you're from...

391
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,960
水真的是从天而降的吗？
Does water really fall from the sky?

392
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,300
哦 是的
Oh, yes.

393
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,930
卡拉丹有时会下一个星期的雨
Sometimes it rains for a weeks, in Caladan

394
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,100
你看这儿的沙子 想象全是水
Where you see sand here, imagine water.

395
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,330
我们的城堡就矗立在海边的悬崖上

396
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,460
就算你一头扎进去 也够不到底

397
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,700
你跳进去了？
You dive in?

398
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:26,960
是的
Yes.

399
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,330

友索
Usul.

402
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,300

-塞哈亚 -塞哈亚
Sihaya.

404
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,460
什么意思？
What does that mean?

405
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,460
意思是沙漠之泉
It means desert spring.

406
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,100
沙漠之泉
Desert spring.

407
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,730
我喜欢它

00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,430
我讨厌它
I hate it.

409
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,860
来自某个愚蠢的预言
It's from some stupid prophecy.

410
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,760
我更喜欢契妮
I prefer Chani.

411
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,360
那我也更喜欢契妮
I prefer Chani too, then.

412
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,960
你觉得斯第尔格会教我吗？
Do you think Stilgar will teach me?

413
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,130
骑沙虫？
To ride?

414
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,830
是啊
Yeah.

415
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,030
不 只有弗雷曼人才会骑沙虫
No, only Fremen ride worms.

416
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,100
我已经是弗雷曼人了 不是吗？
I've become one, didn't I?

417
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,160
只是名字 不是血脉
By name, not by blood.

418
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,130
你的血脉来自公爵 名门望族
Your blood comes from dukes, great houses.

419
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,500
我们这里没有

在这里 我们人人平等 男人和女人都一样
Here, we're equal, men and women alike.

421
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,410
我们这么做都是为了所有人的利益

但我很想被你平等以待

423

保罗·穆阿迪布·友索

也许你可以成为弗雷曼人
Maybe you could be Fremen.

425
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,600
也许我会给你指明道路
Maybe I'll show you the way.

426
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,200

428
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,560
弗雷曼人 在你眼皮底下发动袭击
Fremen attacks on your watch.

429
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,860
你的任务是恢复香料生产
Your orders were to restore spice production

430
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,000
全速开工
To full capacity.

431
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,100
你知道失败意味着什么吗？
Do you know what it means if you fail?

432
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,230
皇帝会让我们失去对香料的控制
The Emperor will take spice out of our control.

433
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,830
撸起袖子 拉班
Tighten your grip, Raban.

434
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,530
叔叔
Uncle.

435
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,200
不然我就撸你脖子
Or feel mine on your neck.

436
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,560
友索
Usul.

437
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,030
没事的

告诉我 这次梦到了什么？
Tell me, what was it about?

443
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,100
一切都模糊不清
Nothing's clear.

444
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,700
只是一些片段
It's only fragments.

445
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
我在南方
I'm in the south,

446
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,770
追赶某个人
and I'm following someone

447
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,260
然后引发了一场圣战
And it triggers a holy war.

448
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,730
成千上万的人饿死
Millions and millions of people starving to death

449
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,230
都是因为我
because of me.

450
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,060
你长时间接触香料
You've been exposed to spice for a long time.

451
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,460
它能产生奇怪的梦

452
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:30,960
今天是个大日子
It's a big day.

453

别耍花招
Nothing fancy

469
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,310
否则你会让我的心血付之东流
or you will shame my teaching

470
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,200
我不会让你丢脸的
I won't shame you.

471
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,460
我明白
I understand.

472

夏胡鲁今天决定你要么成为弗雷曼人

473
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:28,800
要么你死

474
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,070
嘿 穆阿迪布！
Hey, Muad'Dib!

475
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,020
给我们开开眼！

476
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,590
找条大的！

477
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,290
别担心

478
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,260
斯第尔格教得很好

479
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,500
玩笑开够了

480
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,040
这是最后的测试

481
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,720
哇 没见过那么大

482
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,220
加油 穆阿迪布
Hi Muad'Dib!

483
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,320
穆阿迪布
Muad'Dib!

484
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,120
像书上写的那样

485
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,500
圣母！

486
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,670
穆阿迪布驯驭了夏胡鲁

487
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,140
他称它为沙虫爷爷

488
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,810
有史以来最大的

489
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,780
像书上写的那样！

490
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,620
夏胡鲁将向天外之音的男孩臣服

491
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,950
保佑造物主和他的创造

492
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,790
夏胡鲁会不会知道救世主来了？

493
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,430
那就这么说出去

494
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,500
我知道他们会的
I know they do.

495
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,500
我们在北方的任务即将完成
Our task in the north is nearly done.

00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,400
现在我们去南方
Now we go South.

498

那里有数百万正统教派者
There are millions of fundamentalists there.

499
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,530
他们会在保罗到来时保护他

将在南方诞生

00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,480
你会永远爱我吗？

503
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,260
我对你的爱至死不渝
As long as I breathe.

504
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,640
怎么了？
What's wrong?

505
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:43,530
契妮？
Chani?

506
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,300
会出事的
There will be trouble.

507
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,200

What are you talking about?

508

契妮 你什么意思？
Chani, what do you mean?

509
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,770
他们看你的眼神
The way they're looking at you.

510
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,700
他们现在崇拜你
They're worshiping you now.

511

敢死队员指望你带他们打胜仗

513
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,940
……一定是李桑·阿尔-盖布
...must be Lisan al-Gaib

514
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:11,070
我不是弥赛亚
I'm no Messiah.

515
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,670
我是塔布尔穴地的一名敢死队员
I'm a Feydaykin of Sietch Taybr.

516
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,830
可是 我们中间有一位很好的贝尼·杰瑟里特
Yet we have a Bene Gesserit among us,

517
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,930
为你的传奇煽风点火
fanning the flames of your legend,

518
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:22,870
说你就是救世主
saying you're the one.

519
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,700
圣母！

520
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,170

她说你应该和我们一起走

01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,770
她在问为什么

因为我必须继续在北方战斗
Because I must continue fighting in the north

525
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,400
保护你们在南方的安全
to protect you down there in the south.

526
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,970
她说你一说谎她就能看出来
She says she can tell when you lie.

527
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,870
告诉她那是因为我们的母亲

528
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,770
一直在散布危险的谣言

529
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,400
她现在在说什么？
What is she saying now?

530
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,730
她说你被爱情蒙蔽了双眼
She says you're blinded by love,

531
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,130
她还提醒你
And she reminds you that

532
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:24,200
你必须把你的手
you must reserve your hand

533
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,570
留给最具战略意义的联盟
for the most strategic alliance.

534
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,370
她还想知道你为什么不相信
She's also wondering why you don't believe

535
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,700
自己是谁
in who you are.

536
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,380
我相信
I do believe.

537
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,650
我相信我对这些人很重要

538
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,550
我相信我正在改变这场战争
I believe I'm making a difference in this war.

539
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,080
我们快到城门口了
We're nearly at the gates of the city.

540
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,750
她不是这个意思
That's not what she means.

541
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:44,850
我知道她的意思
I know what she means.

542
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,550
难道你不认为我也
Do you not think I also

543
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,780
感受到了预言的重量吗？
feel the weight of the prophecy?

544
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:48,680
这不是预言
It's not a prophecy.

545
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,720
这是你一直在讲的故事
It's a story that you keep telling,

546
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,080
但这不是他们的故事 是你的
but it's not their story, it's yours.

547
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,650
他们应该由自己人领导
They deserve to be led by one of their own.

548
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,280
你们的人对这个世界的所作所为
What your people did to

549
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,380
令人心碎
this world is heartbreaking.

550
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,750
我们给他们带来了希望
We gave them something to hope for.

551
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,450
那不是希望！
That's not hope!

552
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,280
圣母 我们得走了！他们来了

553
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,880
我等着你
I'll be waiting for you.

554

那些风暴看起来很糟糕！
Those storms look bad!

556
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,810
他们是南方的守护神

557
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,840
这是一次艰难的旅程

558
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,180
但夏胡鲁很强大

559
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:37,400
阿拉肯香料仓库

560
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,020
损失多少？！我们上次收成的80%！
How much?! 80% of our last crop!

561
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,100
[听不清]
[inaudible]

562
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,220
你不该离开警戒线的！
You shouldn't have leaved the security perimeter!

563
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,170
警戒线? ！
Security perimeter?!

564
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,120
就剩这些了[听不清]！
The rest are already [inaudible]!

565
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,760
弗雷曼恶魔可能和他们在一起！
The Fremen demon might be with them!

566
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,810
希望如此！
Hope so!

567
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,180
我们正在搜寻他们 大人
We're tracking them, my lord.

568
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,850
今天 我要穆阿迪布死！
Today, Muad'Dib dies!

569
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,410
老鼠逃不了

570
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,550
快！

571
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,950
穆阿迪布！
Muad'Dib!

572
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,220
出来受死！
Show yourself!

573
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:24,620
为了穆阿迪布！
For Muad'Dib!

574
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,970
穆阿迪布
Muad'Dib

575
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,600
一位新的弗雷曼先知
Some new Fremen prophet.

576
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,630
这不是我们第一次和弗雷曼人起冲突
It's not the first time we've had frictions with the Fremen.

577
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,070
没有这么严重的
Not of this magnitude.

578
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,100
那么 我亲爱的女儿
So, my dear daughter,

579
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,830
你会如何对付这位先知？
how would you deal with this prophet?

580
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,200
如果这位穆阿迪布是一个宗教人物
If this Muad'Dib is a religious figure,

581
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,140
你不能直接动用武力
You can't use direct force.

582
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,460
镇压只会使宗教兴盛发达
Repression only makes a religion flourish.

583
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:19,170
最终只能让你自食其果
You'll only end up humiliating yourself.

584
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,400
你低估了我的萨多卡军团
You underestimate my Sardaukhars.

585
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,600
你低估了凡人信仰的力量
You underestimate the power of faith.

586
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,370
公主殿下再一次证明了
Her Highness proves once again

587
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,430
她是我最聪明的学生
that she was my most acute student.

588
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,970
那就派刺客去
Then send assassins.

589
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,500
不 先知死后会变得更强大
No, prophets get stronger when they die.

590
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:41,470
让冲突继续下去
Let the conflict on.

591
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:42,700
让厄拉科斯星球陷入战争
Arrakis turn into war.

592
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,130
然后你会带来和平 成为救世主
You'll then bring peace, as a Savior

593
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,570
而你会成为一个令人敬畏的皇后
You'd be a formidable Empress

594
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,370
穆阿迪布 先知
Muad'Dib. The prophet.

595
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,000
指引方向的人
The one who points the way.

596
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,000
这些是我们自己的宗教风格 不是吗？
These are our own religious patterns, aren't they?

597
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,530
这是我们干的
This is our doing.

598
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,000
穆阿迪布 意思是沙漠老鼠
Muad'Dib. Means kangaroo mouse,

599
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,300
弗雷曼人一个不寻常的战斗名字
An unusual war name for a Fremen.

600
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,440
万一保罗·厄崔迪还活着呢
What if Paul Atreides were still alive.

601
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,530
够了 这件事绝不许说出去
Enough, this must not come out.

602
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,730
那怕连你父亲都不能知道 明白吗？
Even to your father's ears, understand?

603
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:23,800
尊命 圣母
I do Reverend mother.

604
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,300
如果保罗还活着 他很可能知道真相
If Paul is alive, he likely knows the truth.

605
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,970
如果各大家族都知道
And should the great houses learn

606
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,500
你父亲是清算厄崔迪家族的幕后黑手
that your father was behind the liquidation

607
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,570
你父亲将面临战争
of the Atreides, your father will face war

608
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,830
失去王位
and lose the throne.

609
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,270
那希望何在？
Then what hope is there?

610
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,370
希望？
Hope?

611
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:47,070
我们是贝尼·杰瑟里特
We are Bene Gesserit.

612
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,570
我们不希望 我们计划
We don't hope, we plan.

613
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,870
保罗不是我们唯一的希望
Paul is not our only prospect.

614
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,600
男爵最小的侄子
The Baron's youngest nephew,

615
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,900
菲德-罗萨·哈克南 将继承厄拉科斯星球
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

616
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,220
他可能就是答案
He may be the answer.

617
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,540
菲德-罗萨？
Feyd-Rautha?

618
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,160
他有精神病
He's psychotic.

619
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,670
这无关紧要
That's irrelevant.

620
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,760
问题是 我们能控制他吗？
The question is, can we control him?

621
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,530
我打算找出答案
And I intend to find out.

622
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,800
你想来点小鲜肉吗 亲爱的？
Would you like some fresh meats, my darling?

623
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,570
肺 肝脏
Lungs, a liver.

624
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,700
你想要什么？
What would you like?

625

菲德-罗萨男爵

628
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:25,070
有点不平衡 是刀尖
A nudge unbalanced. It's the tip.

629
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,200
应该磨快一点
Should be sharpened.

630
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:41,600
出来

631
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,470
我不会像个傻瓜一样死去

01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:48,530
你想杀了我？
You tried to kill me?

665
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,560
今早你还是个纨绔子弟

01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,970
但今晚你是大英雄 令人畏惧和羡慕的英雄

675
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,770
征服厄拉科斯 费德
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

676
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:30,630
源源不断地生产香料 我就封你为皇帝

677
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:44,500
皇帝？

How?

皇帝助我摧毁了厄崔迪家族
The Emperor helped me destroy the Atreides

680
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,730
他把自己的军队借给我差谴

681
01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:59,000
这是重罪
A serious crime.

682
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,300
如果事情败露的话
If it came to light,

683
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,800
各大家族会联合起来反对他
the Great Houses would rise against him.

684
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:10,600
到那时 谁会坐上王位呢？
And then, who will sit on the throne?

685
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:12,800
菲德-罗萨
Feyd-Rautha

你能带我走出这个迷宫吗
Will you show me the way out of this maze,

691
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,500
我的男爵大人？
My Lord na-Baron?

01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,230
我们见过 不是吗？
We've met, haven't we?

01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,900
我想没有
I don't think so.

694

你是怎么通过守卫的？
How did you get past the guards?

698
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,420
守卫？
The Guards?

699
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:39,570
请问你在这里做什么？
May I ask what are you doing here?

700
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:44,830
你不是来参加自己的庆典的
You're not taking part in your own celebrations.

701
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,640
你是贝尼·杰瑟里特
You're Bene Gesserit

702
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:01,270
你为什么这么说？
And what makes you say that?

703
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:03,530
我想起来了……
I remember now...

704
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,200
我昨晚梦见你了
I dreamed about you last night.

705

希望是个美梦
A pleasant dream, I hope.

01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,670
别嘲笑我 女人
Don't mock me, woman.

707
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:10,770
我不敢
I wouldn't dare.

708
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,430
我知道你的贝尼·杰瑟里特小把戏？
I know your Bene Gesserit tricks?

709
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,400
你对贝尼·杰瑟里特了解多少？
And what do you know about Bene Gesserit?

710
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,230
告诉我

711
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,230
出什么事了？
Is something wrong?

712
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:29,900
我不认识这个地方

01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:34,800
但你是预言的一部分
prophecy but you're a part of it.

1038
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:36,520
你就是毒药
You're the poison.

1039
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:38,220
你和你的谎言
You and your lies.

1040
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,440
-你为什么要这么对我？ -做吧
Why would you do this to me? Do it.

1041
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:54,400
他会死而复生

1042
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,330
用沙漠之泉的泪水

1043
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:02,470
给我一滴生命之水

1044
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,140
像书上写的那样

1045
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,530
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1046
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,060
是的
Yes.

1047
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:12,080
你确定？
Are you sure?

1048
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:16,720
多亏了你
Thanks to you.

1049
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:03,870
契妮的事我很难过
I'm sorry about Chani.

1050
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:07,860
她会理解的
She'll come to understand.

1051
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,880
我看见了
I've seen it.

1052
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:12,330
你能看见了
You can see.

1053
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:15,500
现在幻象变得清晰
The visions are clear now.

1054
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:21,400
我一下子看到了所有可能的未来
I see possible futures all at once.

1055
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,370
我们的敌人无处不在
Our enemies are all around us.

1056
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:28,030
这不是他们唯一的未来
That's not the only future they prevail.

1057
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,930
我确实看到一条路
I do see a way.

1058
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:34,500
有一条狭窄的通路
There is a narrow way through.

1059
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:46,430
我看到了我们母亲的血脉
I saw our bloodline mother.

1060
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:49,700
穿越时空
Written across time.

1061
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:03,800
你是
You're the daughter of

1062
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,600
弗拉基米尔・哈克南男爵的女儿
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

1063
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:09,980
我父亲知道吗？
Did my father know?

1064
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,560
我自己也不知道 直到
I didn't know myself until

1065
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,800
我服下沙虫的毒药
I took the worm's poison.

1066
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,920
我们是哈克南人
We're Harkonnens.

1067
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,050
这就是我们存在的方式
So this is how we'll survive.

1068
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:38,000
通过成为哈克南人
By being Harkonnens.

1069
02:01:14,370 --> 02:01:15,570
我们得谈谈
We must talk.

1070
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:18,430
斯第尔格
Stilgar.

1071
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:20,300
你可以阻止这一切！
You can stop this!

1072
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:21,180
你听到了吗？
Do you hear me?

1073
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,720
你有能力阻止这一切！
You have the power to stop this!

1074
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:25,720
你不能在圈子里说话 北方女人
You're not to want to speak inside the circle. Northern woman.

1075
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:27,700
如果你想说话 你知道该怎么做
If you want to speak, you know what to do.

1076
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:28,330
斯第尔格 求你了
Stilgar, please.

1077
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:30,900
厄拉科斯正在沉沦
Arrakis is sinking.

1078
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:46,740
他们通过预言来奴役我们
This prophecy is how they enslave us.

1079
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:47,570
这是他们的统治方式
How they dominate.

1080
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:50,530
你会惹上麻烦的
You'll get yourself in trouble.

1081
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,470
这不关你的事
This is none your business.

1082
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:55,000
拉班·哈克南亲手杀了我的家人
Raban Harkonnen himself killed my family.

1083
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,900
他给了我这道伤疤 让我记住他
He gave me this scar to remember him by.

1084
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:58,330
这全是我的私人恩怨
This is all of my business.

1085
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:46,530
穆阿迪布 只有部落首领才能说话
Muad'dib. Only tribe leaders can speak

1086
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,600
如果你想发表你的声音
If you wish to share your voice,

1087
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,600
你必须通过打败他来取代他的位置
You must take his place by defeating him

1088
02:02:52,630 --> 02:02:54,570
然后把他的水放回井里
and returning his water to the well.

1089
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:57,030
你觉得我会愚蠢到褫夺一位
You think I'm stupid enough to deprive

1090
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:58,730
我们当中最优秀的人
myself of the best of us.

1091
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:02,520
你会在战斗前砸碎刀子吗？

1092
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:04,270
杀了我吧 友索
Take my life, Usul.

1093
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,200
这是唯一的途径
It is the only way.

1094
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:09,000
我在指路！
I'm pointing the way!

1095
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:12,840
慢一点
Slow down.

1096
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:16,240
这个房间里没有……

1097
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,670
……谁能对抗我

1098
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:35,420
你的母亲警告过你我会来

1099
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:39,060
害怕这一刻

1100
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:51,030
但你觉得自己还有机会
But you think you could have a chance.

1101
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:56,140
可你害怕了

1102
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,150
如果我是你的救世主呢？

1103
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:04,420
这可能是你一生都在祈祷的时刻

1104
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:09,290
现在你在祈祷……

1105
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:11,090
……向你的祖母……

1106
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:15,330
……她九个月前去世了

1107
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:19,270
她失去了一只眼睛

1108
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,540
当她穿越沙暴时 一块石头砸中了她的脸

1109
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:26,910
事情发生时 她才十二岁

1110
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:32,210
当时 这个世界有一个弗雷曼人 他的名字叫

1111
02:04:34,210 --> 02:04:35,620
沙丘
Dune.

1112
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,450
李桑·阿尔-盖布！
Lisan al-Gaib!

1113
02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:41,180
救世主
Mahdi.

1114
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:49,130
在你的噩梦里

1115
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,570
你给死去的人浇水

1116
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:53,840
这让你的心充满了喜悦

1117
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:05,480
救世主 你对我们的预测是什么？

1118
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:09,350
绿色天堂

1119
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:12,740
李桑·阿尔-盖布……

1120
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:15,290
……给我们指明道路！

1121
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:23,330
这是我父亲的公爵印章
This is my father's ducal signet.

1122
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:39,070
我是保罗·穆阿迪布·厄崔迪 厄拉科斯公爵
I am Paul Muad'Dib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1123
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,680
上帝之手为我作证

1124
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:44,550
我是天外之声

1125
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,190
我会带领你们

1126
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:47,590
上天堂！

1127
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:49,130
保罗·厄崔迪还活着
Paul Atreides is still alive.

1128
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,340
他向我父亲发起挑战
He challenges my father.

1129
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:55,730
你从没踏足厄拉科斯星球
You've never been on Arrakis.

1130
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:59,230
那里令人难以忘怀 你会看到的
It's quite impressive, you'll see.

1131
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:00,770
这全是你的主意吗？
Was this all upon your advice?

1132
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:01,100
什么？
What?

1133
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:04,270
你建议我父亲消灭
Did you counsel my father

1134
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:05,870
厄崔迪斯家族？
to exterminate the Atreides?

1135
02:07:05,930 --> 02:07:06,830
当然是我
Of course I did.

1136
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:08,670
不然为什么会发生这种事？
Why else would it have happened?

1137
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:11,600
你试图牺牲整个血脉
You tried to sacrifice an entire bloodline.

1138
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,200
我这么做是对的
And I was right to do it.

1139
02:07:13,970 --> 02:07:17,040
魁萨茨·哈德拉克是一种力量
The Kwisatz Haderach is a form of power

1140
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:19,100
我们的世界还从未见识过的
that our world has not yet seen.

1141
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:21,360
终极力量
The ultimate power.

1142
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:23,970
九十代以来
For ninety generations we have

1143
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,430
监督着厄崔迪家族
supervised House Atreides.

1144
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:27,100
他们很有前途 但他们
They were promising, but they were

1145
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:28,570
变得非常危险
becoming dangerously defiant.

1146
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,170
他们的血脉必须被终结
Their bloodline had to be terminated.

1147
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:34,800
这就是为什么我们让许多血脉运作
That is why we have put many bloodlines at work.

1148
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:35,900
几个有前途的
Several prospects.

1149
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,330
但适得其反
But it's backfired.

1150
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:38,570
保罗还活着
Paul is alive.

1151
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,170
如果他打败了
And if he defeats.

1152
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:41,430
维德拉瑟 我父亲……
Vaidrathir, my father is...

1153
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:42,670
你父亲会失去王位
Your father will lose the throne, no

1154
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:43,500
不管谁获胜
matter who prevails.

1155
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:46,630
但是有一种方法
But there is one way your

1156
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:48,370
可以让你的家族继续掌权
family can remain in power.

1157
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:49,730
通过你
And through you, the

1158
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:51,870
延续我们的统治

1159
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,500
只有一条路 你准备好了吗

1160
02:07:58,170 --> 02:07:59,170
你一直在帮我安排
You've been preparing me my

1161
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,730
我的一生 圣母
whole life, Reverend Mother.

1162
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,220
你要和其他人一起去北方吗？
You're heading North with the others?

1163
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,720
我是敢死队员
I'm feydaykin.

1164
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,330
我跟随我的队长 如果
I follow my leaders. If

1165
02:08:08,330 --> 02:08:10,160
战斗往北 我往北
fighting goes north, I go north.

1166
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:11,960
保罗别无选择 契妮
Paul didn't have a choice, Chani.

1167
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,300
我不会为他而战
I won't be fighting for him.

1168
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:15,400
我为我的人民而战
I'm fighting for my people.

1169
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:21,030
我是来祝你好运的
I came to wish you best of luck.

1170
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:23,630
我也祝你好运
I'd wish you the same.

1171
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:27,870
但看起来你已经赢得了战斗
But it seems you've won your battle.

1172
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:52,180
他们上钩了
They took the bait.

1173
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,260
皇帝陛下真是兢兢业业
The Emperor is very obliging.

1174
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:03,600
他很准时
He's right on time.

1175
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,490
正如你所预见的 穆阿迪布

1176
02:09:08,690 --> 02:09:10,920
沙暴祖母要来了

1177
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,560
他来这里做什么？
What is he doing here?

1178
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,300
我控制了香料生产
I brought spice production under control.

1179
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:45,680
我们该怎么办？
What do we do?

1180
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,540
给各大家族发信息
Send messages to the great Houses.

1181
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:51,240
告诉他们厄拉科斯正遭受

1182
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,440

02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:57,160
告诉他们 他们的未来岌岌可危
Tell them their future hangs in the balance.

1184
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:23,360
他带来了整支军队

1185
02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:26,130
当沙暴袭击这里山脊时
When the storm hits this ridge,

1186
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:28,800
哥尼会为你开辟道路 斯第尔格
Gurney will open the way for you Stilgar.

1187
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,300
这样你就可以从西面进入盆地
So you can enter the basin from the west

1188
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:33,730
吸引他们防御系统的注意力
and distract their defense systems.

1189
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,740
契妮 我要你和你的敢死队员
Chani, I want you and your Feydaykins

1190
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,330
从东面发起进攻
to then attack from the east,

1191
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:39,400
杀入盆地
Inside the basin.

1192

我率领正统教派军队从北面进攻
I'll strike from the north and head on

1193
02:10:42,330 --> 02:10:44,030
长趋直入
with the fundamentalist troops.

1194
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:46,670
而我将拿下厄拉克斯 如探囊取物
And I'll serve Arrakeen for dessert.
