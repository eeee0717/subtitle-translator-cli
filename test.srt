我没睡着

70
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,560
我来吧

71
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,410
阿拉肯 北厄拉科斯星球首府

72
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,260

撤出弗雷曼人的区域

76
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,160
我们在沙漠里损失了太多人
We're losing too many men to the desert

77
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,730
老鼠
Rats.

78
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,130
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

79
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,230
我们损失的人……

给了老鼠
To rats.

81
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,890
弗雷曼人

82
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,790
我无法确认 大人
I can't confirm, my Lord.

83
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,460
在开阔的沙地上通讯很混乱
Communications are hectic in the open sands.

84
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,890
你的任务

这只是一半
That's only half of it.

88
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,990
你可能还记得 南方不适合居住 大人
As you may recall, the south is uninhabtable, my Lord

89
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,560
我建议你休息一下 好吗？

90
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:53,730

老鼠！

94
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,560
他问我们为什么迟到了
He's asking why we're so late.

95
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
他认为你们是间谍
He thinks you're spies.

96
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,260
这里不欢迎你们

97
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,660
他说……

塔布尔穴地
Sietch Tabr

102
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,610
詹米! 詹米！

103
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,080
你杀了詹米！

104
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,380
间谍！

105
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,080
女巫！

106
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,470
住手! 住手！

107
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,040
他们不知道自己在说什么

108
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,640
李桑·阿尔-盖布! 李桑·阿尔-盖布！

109
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,080
救世主！

110
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,320
我需要你指引我们怎么处理那两个外国人

111
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,660
把他们交给沙漠

112
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,630
我看到了征兆

113
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,300
又来了

114
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,500
斯第尔格 你的信仰蒙蔽了你的双眼

115
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,410
李桑·阿尔-盖布还没出世呢！

116
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,050
他在一场公平的决斗中战胜了詹米

117
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,290
他会说我们的语言

118
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,920
他很快就会学会我们的生存之道

119
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,690
我愿意为他献出生命

120
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,330
沙漠将决定他的命运

121
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,270
那个女人呢？

122
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,730
看来贝尼·杰瑟里特的宣传已经深入人心
Looks like the Bene Gesserit's ' propaganda has taken root

123
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,820
有些人已经认为我是他们的救世主了
Some of them already think I'm their messiah.

124
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,130
其他人 则认为我是假先知
Others, false prophet.

125
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,460
我必须说服那些不信的人
I must sway the non-believers.

126
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,990
如果他们跟着我 我们就可以
If they follow me, we can

127
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,060
破坏香料生产
disrupt spice production.

128
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,430
只有这条路我才能接近皇帝
That's the only way I can get to the emperor.

129
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,890
你父亲不相信复仇
Your father didn't believe in revenge.

130
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,960
我相信
Hell, I do.

131
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,260
怎么了？
What is happening?

132
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
外国人吃不了辣？

133
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,360
怎么回事？
What is it?

134
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,230
食物里有香料
There's spice in the food.

135
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,220
他蓝眼睛一定很好看

136
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,360
别嘲笑他

137
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,490
他值得我们尊重 他是个好战士

138
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,590
女人 跟我来
Woman, come with me.

139
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,400
放回井里 我们的水回来了

140
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,770
我们祝福我们的兄弟 詹米

141
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,660
三千八百万公升
38 million decaliters.

142
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,160
我们即使渴死
None of us, even dying of thirst

143
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,160
也不会喝这的水
would ever drink this water.

144
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,330
这是神圣的
This is sacred.

145
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,160
创世纪之水
Genesis water.

146
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,730
我们有几千个这样的地方
We have thousands of places.

147
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,960
我们有足够的水源
where we have enough water.

148
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,890
李桑·阿尔-盖布将会
The Lisan al-Gaib will

149
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,190
改变厄拉科斯星球的面貌
Change the face of Arrakis

150
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,930
它将使树木重生 它将使……
It will bring back trees, it will bring back...

151
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,790
绿色天堂重现
a green paradise.

152
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,330
这么多灵魂
So many souls

153
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
永远不要把你的水给别人
Never give your water away,

154
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,830
即使死人也不行
not even for the dead.

155
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,660
你为什么带我看这些？
Why are you showing me this?

156
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,490
因为你是贝尼·杰瑟里特
Because you are Bene Gesserit

157
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,760
因为你了解预言
Because you understand the prophecies.

158
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,930
李桑·阿尔-盖布的母亲
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib

159
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,860
会成为圣母
will be a Reverend mother.

160
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,690
我们的圣母快死了
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

161
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,190
你想让我代替她？
You want me to take her place?

162
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,790
是的
Yes,

163
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,590
我想
I do.

164
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,630
你相信保罗吗？

165
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,490
有征兆
There are signs.

166
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,660
是的
Yes.

167
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,930
如果我拒绝呢？
What if I would refuse?

168
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,430
那他就不是李桑·阿尔-盖布
Then he is not Lisan al-Gaib,

169
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,160
你就没有任何意义了
And you have no purpose to serve.

170
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,990
那你还能做什么？
What else is left to do then?

171
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,330
把你的水放回井里？
But return your water to the well?

172
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,890
这是种荣誉 不是吗？
It's an honor, isn't it?

173
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,660
我觉得你应该感到荣幸
I think you should feel honored.

174
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,330
这是生死决择
It was a choice between this or death,

175
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,290
所以请原谅我的不敬
so forgive me if I'm not flattered.

176
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,660
一个人怎样才能当上圣母？
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

177
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,830
不同的文化是不同的
It's different from one culture to another.

178
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,660
在厄拉科斯星球 我不知道
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

179
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,830
你害怕了
You're afraid.

180
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,660
圣母肩负着
A Reverend Mother has the task

181

保存他们以前历代圣母的

00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,430
全部记忆的使命
of all the Reverend Mothers that came before them,

183
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,160
所以我会被赐予几个世纪的痛苦与悲伤
so I'll be given centuries of pain and sorrow.

184
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,930
危险吗？
Is it dangerous?

185
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,330
对男人来说是致命的
It's lethal for men.

186
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,190
绝对是
That's for sure.

187
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,590
你们在笑什么？
What are you guys laughing about?

188
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,160
别管了
Don't bother.

189
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,860
你不相信这一切？
You don't believe in all this?

190
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,860
不 我们不信
No, we don't.

191
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,930
这些都是南方的信仰
These are all Southern beliefs.

192
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,360
南方的信仰？
Southern beliefs?

193
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,730
南方部落相信弥赛亚
Southern tribes believe that a Messiah

194
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,190
会来拯救我们脱离邪恶
will come to deliver us from evil.

195
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,990
你不相信李桑·阿尔-盖布？
You don't believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

196
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,260
我们相信弗雷曼人
We believe in Fremen

197
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,830
阿门

198
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,660
你想控制别人？
You want to control people?

199
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,060
你告诉他们救世主会来
You tell them a Messiah will come.

200
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
然后他们会等上几个世纪
Then they'll wait, for centuries.

201
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,530
现在 我们必须祈祷
Now, we must pray.

202
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,560
他怎么了？
What about him?

203
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,730
斯第尔格？
Stilgar?

204
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,890
他是南方人
He's from the South.

205
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,760
你没注意到他的口音
You didn't notice his accent.

206
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,630
我妈妈会怎么样？
What'll happen to my mother?
