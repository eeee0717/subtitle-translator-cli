厄拉科斯之战举世震惊
The battle for Arrakis took everyone by surprise.

5
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,460
没有目击者
There were no witnesses.

6
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,260
哈克南人的行动是在
The Harkonnen operation was perpetrated

7
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,130
未经警告或宣战的情况下 趁夜间进行的
overnight without warning or declaration of war.

8
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,960
到了早上 厄崔迪家族被消灭殆尽
By morning, the Atreides were no more.

9
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,930
悉数殒命长夜
All died in the dark.

10
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,030
而皇帝……
And the Emperor said...

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,960
沉默无语

12
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,490
从那天晚上起 我父亲就变了
Since that night my father has not been the same.

13
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,330
我也是

14
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,030
他的哀伤憔悴让我心如刀割
His inaction is difficult for me to accept.

15
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,590
因为我知道他像爱儿子一样爱着雷托·厄崔迪公爵

这已经不是第一次

18
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,930
哈克南家族为他做的肮脏勾当
Harkonnens have done his dirty work.

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,890
在厄拉科斯星球的阴影下埋藏着许多秘密
In the shadows of Arrakis lie many secrets.

20
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,360
但其中最黑暗的可能就是……

21
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,890
厄崔迪家族的末日
The end of House Atreides.

父亲死了
Father is dead.

25
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,330
你不是应该回到星际去吗？
Shouldn't you go back to the stars?

26
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,590
和他在一起
Be with him.

27
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,630
恐怕我没有足够的时间
I'm afraid I won't have enough time to

28
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,030
在你降生之前处理好事情

29
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,090
这个世界无比残酷
This world is beyond cruelty.

33
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,860
他们就在附近

34
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,490
听到了吗？

35
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,330
老鼠在召唤沙虫

36
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,370
沙虫！

37
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,170

38
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,430
注意沙虫迹象

安全

40
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,920
打开屏蔽场！

41
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,480
没有屏蔽场！

42
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,510

43
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,090
永远不要背对敌人站着
Never stand with your back towards the opponent.

44
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,830
我跟你说过多少回了？
How many times do I have to tell you that?

45
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,290
你没事吧？
You okay?

她怎样？
How about her?

她很好
She's fine.

49
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,860
他们通常不这么深入
They do not usually venture this deep.

50
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,730
他们想把厄崔迪家族斩草除根 赶尽杀绝
They want to make sure no Atreides escaped.

51
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,690
你太自以为是了
You think too much of yourself.

52
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,830
不 不 我们在沙漠深处

他们是来找我们的 不是来找你们的
They were here for us, not for you.

55
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,630
别担心
Don't worry.

我带你们去一个他们永远找不到的地方
I'm taking you somewhere they will never find us.

里面全是化学物质 不过
It's full of chemicals, but

59
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,130
用于冷却系统还可以

别吐出来
Don't let it out.

61

我们在沙漠里损失了太多人

你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

79
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,230
我们损失的人……

在开阔的沙地上通讯很混乱
Communications are hectic in the open sands.

84

你可能还记得 南方不适合居住 大人

我建议你休息一下 好吗？

你杀了詹米！

104
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,380
间谍！

105
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,080
女巫！

106
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,470
住手! 住手！

107
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,040
他们不知道自己在说什么

108
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,640
李桑·阿尔-盖布! 李桑·阿尔-盖布！

109
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,080
救世主！

110
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,320
我需要你指引我们怎么处理那两个外国人

111
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,660
把他们交给沙漠

112
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,630
我看到了征兆

113
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,300
又来了

114
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,500
斯第尔格 你的信仰蒙蔽了你的双眼

115
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,410
李桑·阿尔-盖布还没出世呢！

116
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,050
他在一场公平的决斗中战胜了詹米

117
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,290
他会说我们的语言

118
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,920
他很快就会学会我们的生存之道

119
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,690
我愿意为他献出生命

120
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,330
沙漠将决定他的命运

121
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,270
那个女人呢？

122
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,730
看来贝尼·杰瑟里特的宣传已经深入人心

有些人已经认为我是他们的救世主了
Some of them already think I'm their messiah.

124
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,130
其他人 则认为我是假先知
Others, false prophet.

125
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,460
我必须说服那些不信的人
I must sway the non-believers.

126
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,990
如果他们跟着我 我们就可以
If they follow me, we can

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,060
破坏香料生产
disrupt spice production.

128

只有这条路我才能接近皇帝
That's the only way I can get to the emperor.

129

你父亲不相信复仇

怎么了？
What is happening?

132
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
外国人吃不了辣？

133
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,360
怎么回事？
What is it?

134
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,230
食物里有香料
There's spice in the food.

135
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,220
他蓝眼睛一定很好看

136
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,360
别嘲笑他

137
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,490
他值得我们尊重 他是个好战士

138
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,590
女人 跟我来
Woman, come with me.

139
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,400
放回井里 我们的水回来了

140

我们即使渴死
None of us, even dying of thirst

143
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,160
也不会喝这的水
would ever drink this water.

144
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,330
这是神圣的
This is sacred.

145

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,890
李桑·阿尔-盖布将会

改变厄拉科斯星球的面貌

150

151
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,790
绿色天堂重现

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,330
这么多灵魂
So many souls

153
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
永远不要把你的水给别人
Never give your water away,

154
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,830
即使死人也不行
not even for the dead.

155
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,660
你为什么带我看这些？
Why are you showing me this?

156
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,490
因为你是贝尼·杰瑟里特
Because you are Bene Gesserit

157
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,760

The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib

159
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,860
会成为圣母

160
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,690
我们的圣母快死了
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

161
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,190
你想让我代替她？
You want me to take her place?

163

那他就不是李桑·阿尔-盖布
Then he is not Lisan al-Gaib,

169
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,160
你就没有任何意义了
And you have no purpose to serve.

170
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,990
那你还能做什么？
What else is left to do then?

171
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,330
把你的水放回井里？
But return your water to the well?

172
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,890
这是种荣誉 不是吗？
It's an honor, isn't it?

173
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,660
我觉得你应该感到荣幸
I think you should feel honored.

174
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,330
这是生死决择
It was a choice between this or death,

175
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,290
所以请原谅我的不敬
so forgive me if I'm not flattered.

176
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,660
一个人怎样才能当上圣母？
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

177
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,830
不同的文化是不同的
It's different from one culture to another.

178
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,660
在厄拉科斯星球 我不知道
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

179
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,830
你害怕了
You're afraid.

180
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,660
圣母肩负着
A Reverend Mother has the task

181
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,590
保存他们以前历代圣母的
of holding the memories

182
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,430
全部记忆的使命
of all the Reverend Mothers that came before them,

183
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,160
所以我会被赐予几个世纪的痛苦与悲伤
so I'll be given centuries of pain and sorrow.

184
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,930
危险吗？
Is it dangerous?

185
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,330
对男人来说是致命的
It's lethal for men.

186
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,190
绝对是
That's for sure.

187
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,590
你们在笑什么？
What are you guys laughing about?

188
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,160
别管了
Don't bother.

189
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,860
你不相信这一切？
You don't believe in all this?

190
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,860
不 我们不信
No, we don't.

191
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,930
这些都是南方的信仰
These are all Southern beliefs.

192
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,360
南方的信仰？
Southern beliefs?

193
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,730
南方部落相信弥赛亚
Southern tribes believe that a Messiah

194
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,190
会来拯救我们脱离邪恶
will come to deliver us from evil.

195
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,990
你不相信李桑·阿尔-盖布？
You don't believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

196
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,260
我们相信弗雷曼人
We believe in Fremen

197
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,830
阿门

198
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,660
你想控制别人？
You want to control people?

199
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,060
你告诉他们救世主会来
You tell them a Messiah will come.

200
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
然后他们会等上几个世纪
Then they'll wait, for centuries.

201
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,530
现在 我们必须祈祷
Now, we must pray.

202
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,560
他怎么了？
What about him?

203
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,730
斯第尔格？
Stilgar?

204
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,890
他是南方人
He's from the South.

205
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,760
你没注意到他的口音
You didn't notice his accent.

206
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,630
我妈妈会怎么样？
What'll happen to my mother?

207
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,150
她会喝沙虫的尿

208
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,550
一点都不好笑

209
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,220
他就要失去她了

210
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,150
如果她蠢到喝毒药的话

211
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,390
住口！住口！

212
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,030
我们在祈祷

213
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,680
这是生命之水

214
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,620
它能解放心灵

215
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,990
如果你喝的话

216
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,390
你就会死去

217
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,830
如果你喝的话

218
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,970
你可以看见

219
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,570
喝！

220
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,670
这是什么？

221
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,590
我们做了什么？

222
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,260
她怀孕了

223
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,670
那不是奇迹！

224
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,640
你亲眼看到的！

225
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,950
李桑·阿尔-盖布的母亲

226
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,910
将在神圣的毒药试炼中幸存

227
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,450
她做到了

228
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,180
像书上写的那样！

229
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,090
那是她的族人写的！

230
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,990
亵渎神明

231
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,730
预言已经实现了

232
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,530
救世主必须是弗雷曼人！

233
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,030
厄拉科斯必须由自己的人民来解放！

234
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,560
她说得对 她说得对
She's right.

235
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,680
这不是奇迹
It's no miracle.

236
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,070
我妈妈受过这方面的训练
My mother was trained to do that.

237
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,300
把毒素转化成别的东西
Poison transmutation is something

238
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,300
高级贝尼·杰瑟里特可以做到
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

239
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,300
我不是救世主
I'm not the Mahdi.

240
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,230
我不是来领导的
I'm not here to lead.

241
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,760
我是来学习你们的生存之道的

242
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,900
我在这里与你们并肩作战
I'm here to fight beside you.

243
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,800
这是我唯一的要求
That's all I'm asking.

244
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,750
我很谦虚地说他是救世主

245
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,020
更有理由相信他是！

246
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,820
像书上写的那样！

247
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,130
她怎么样？
How is she?

248
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,130
她很害怕 但她没事
She was frightened but she's okay.

249
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,130
她跟我说话
She talks to me.

250
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,030
她相信你
She believes in you.

251
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,400
她说
She says

252
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,830
魁萨茨·哈德拉克给我们指明道路

253
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
你就快成功了
You're so close now.

254
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,300
只有一步之遥
Only one step remains.

255
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,700
你会成为魁萨茨·哈德拉克
you will become the Kwisatz Haderach.

256
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,170
只有一步之遥
Only one step remains.

257
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,470
你必须像我一样
You must do what I did.

258
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,830
你必须喝下生命之水
You must drink the water of life.

259
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,870
你会解放心灵 你将看见
Your mind is gonna open and you will see.

260
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,020
你将看见！

261
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,350
美丽与恐怖！

262
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
如果你想和我们并肩战斗
If you want to fight with us,

263
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,570
首先你必须学会
first thing you must learn

264
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,970
与沙漠融为一体
to be one with the desert.

265
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,870
这里有帐篷和足够的食物
So here is a tent and enough food.

266
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,400
我要你走到那个小沙丘 然后返回
I want you to cross that small erg and come back.

267
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:50,930
晚上回来
Come by night.

268
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,600
你知道怎么用指南针
You know how to use a paracompass.

269
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,030
会的
Yes.

270
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,970
还有什么我需要知道的吗？
Anything else I should know?

271
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,200
除了沙虫和哈克南人
Beside the worms and the Harkonnens,

272
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,070
小心土蜘蛛
beware of the trap door spiders.

273
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,570
蜈蚣也很讨厌
Centipedes are very nasty.

274
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,730
不是那些大的
Not the big ones.

275
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,000
大的无害
They are harmless.

276
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,170
但小的你就要注意了
But the little ones you have to worry about.

277
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,300
千万 千万别听巨灵的话
Don't ever, ever listen to the Djinn.

278
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,400
巨灵
The Djinn.

279
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,000
巨灵 沙漠之魂
Djinn, desert spirits.

280
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,270
他们在夜晚轻言细语
They whisper at night.

281
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,870
他们会魅惑你
They can possess you.

282
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,100
真的 小心点
Really, be careful.

283
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,030
他们是恶魔
They are demons.

284
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,670
但这是真的
But it's true.

285
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,530
别听他们的
Don't listen to them.

286
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,640
他不知道如何穿越沙地

287
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,440
斯第尔格会害死他的

288
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,810
他想证明什么？

289
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,080
你觉得呢？

290
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,120
“先知必知道沙漠的道路”

291
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,360
我觉得这样最好

292
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,700
是不是这样？

293
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,170
你现在关心他了？

294
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,400
他和其他陌生人不一样

295
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,940
他很真诚

296
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,670
詹米
Jamis

297
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,730
你走起路来像只喝醉的蜥蜴
You sand walk like a drunk lizard.

298
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,900
是么 目前为止我做得还不赖
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good so far.

299
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,080
我们还没进入沙虫的地盘呢
We're not even in worm territory yet.

300
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,900
你得打破你的节奏
You have to break up your rhythm.

301
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,170
像这样
Like this.

302
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,300
这很有趣 因为在胶片书里
Now that's interesting because in the film books

303
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,600
我研究过 人类学家说
I've studied, the anthropologists say in order

304
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,570
你必须按照一定的规律，才能在沙地上行走
to properly sand walk, you actually have to.

305
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,930
算了
Nevermind.

306
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,370
请继续
Please keep going.

307
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,530
你知道 我是唯一一个相信
You know, I'm the only one who believes

308
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,700
你会撑到夏天的人
you're gonna make it until summer.

309
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,600
如果你想在沙漠里跟上我们
If you wanna follow us in the desert,

310
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,970
你就得知道捕风器的原理
you need to know how wind traps work.

311
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,130
所以听我说
So listen to me.

312
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,730
我总是觉得很简单
It's always neat to me.

313
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,730
它们很简单 但需要时刻留意
They're simple, but they require constant attention.

314
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,670
啥？
What?

315
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,900
别这样看着我
Stop looking at me like that.

316
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,530
你说得对
You're right.

317
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,730
如果我们想保护你的哥哥
If we want to protect your brother,

318
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,130
我们需要所有弗雷曼人都相信预言
we need all the Fremen to believe in the prophecy.

319
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,300
我们必须一个接一个地改变不信者的信仰
We must convert the non-believers one by one.

320
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,130
我们得从弱者开始
We need to start with the weaker ones.

321
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,400
意志簿弱的人
the vulnerable ones.

322
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,700
那些害怕我们的人
The ones that fear us.

323
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,710
契妮！
Chani!

324
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,570
装弹
Reload.

325
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,820
装弹
Reload.

326
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,300
屏蔽场 只有直升机开火时才会关闭
The shield. They only open when they're firing.

327
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,900
我知道
I know that.

328
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,860
你以为我在做什么？
What do you think I'm trying to do?

329
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,760
我做引子
I'm triggering.

330
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,700
等我信号
On my signal.

331
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,630
准备
Be ready.

332
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,930
哦 该死
Oh shit.

333
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,970
你看到他做了什么

334
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,110
他早就料到了

335
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,310
他救了她的命

336
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,780
他看到了

337
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,650
他能预见

338
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,120
穆阿迪布喜欢他的味道

339
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,730
谁教你这样战斗的？
Who taught you to fight like that?

340
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,560
我以前的师傅
My old masters.

341
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,080
他们是很要好的朋友
And they were close friends.

342
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,060
他们被屠杀了 和我父亲一起
They were a massacred. Alongside my father.

343
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,650
你们与哈克南人作战几十年
You've been fighting The Harkonnens for decades.

344
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,030
我的家族已经与他们争斗了几个世纪

345
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,900
他们的习惯 他们的思维方式 我了如指掌

你们对沙漠了如指掌

347
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,900
你们驾驭沙漠的力量

348
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
我们可以一起阻止他们
We can stop them together.

349
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,660
让他们死无丧身之沙
Bury them in the sand where they belong.

350
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,960
让这个星球再次属于你们
So that this planet can be yours once more.

351
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,260
你要我们做什么？
What will you have us do?

352
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,330
你会怎么做 斯第尔格？
What would you do, Stilgar?

353
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,960
我会挥戈北上
I would strike even further north.

354
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,060
那我挥戈北上
Then I will go further north.

355
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
你越往北走
The further north you go,

356
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,930
你越可能死
the more likely it is you die.

357
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,080
我会死

358
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,720
也许你也会死

359
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,750
但其他人会继续前进

360
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,760
直到弗雷曼人获得自由为止 否则他们是不会罢休的

361
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,730
他应该加入弗雷曼敢死队

362
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,270
他需要个名字 斯第尔格

363
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,740
好样的！好样的！

364
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,560
我在你身上看到了力量
I see strength in you.

365
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,440
像友索一样

366
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,080
意思是“梁柱的底座”

367
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
过来 过来
Come, come.

368
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,300
在我们中间 你应该被称为友索
You shall be known among us as Usul.

369
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,400
友索
Usul.

370
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,200
现在 你加入了弗雷曼敢死队 成为一名战士
And now a Fedaykin is a fighter.

371
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,730
你还必须选一个

372
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,730
战斗用的名字
You must choose.

373
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:43,130
你们怎么称呼这只沙漠小老鼠来着？
How do you call the small desert mouse again?

374
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,460
穆阿迪布 穆阿迪布

375
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,230

376
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,760
哦 不 穆阿迪布是很聪明的

377

穆阿迪布深知沙漠的生存之道

378
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,830
穆阿迪布 能自己制造水

379
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,060
能辩别指向北方的星座

380
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,560
所以我们叫它穆阿迪布
we call Muad'Dib.

381
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,100
指引方向的人
The one who points the way.

00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,580
真美啊
It's breathtaking.

388
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,660
看 这就是香料
Look, right there's spice

389
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,560
每当夕阳落暮的时候 厄拉科斯星球格外动人
Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low.

390
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,730
在你的家乡
Where you're from...

391
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,960
水真的是从天而降的吗？
Does water really fall from the sky?

392
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,300
哦 是的

卡拉丹有时会下一个星期的雨

397
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,700
你跳进去了？
You dive in?

398
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:26,960
是的
Yes.

399
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,330
这叫游泳
It's called swimming.

400
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,500
我可不相信 友索
