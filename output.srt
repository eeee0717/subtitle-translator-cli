00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,960
By morning, the Atreides were wiped out.
By morning, the Atreides were no more.

Silence
Nothing.

12
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,490
My father was never the same from that night on.
Since that night my father has not been the same.

13
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,330
Me too
Nor have I.

14
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,030
His sadness and haggardness broke my heart
His inaction is difficult for me to accept.

15
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,590
Because I know he loves Lord Leto Atreides like a son.
For I know he loved Duke Leto Atreides, like a son

Did you hear that?

35
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,330
The rats are calling the sandworms

36
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,370
Sandworm!

37
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,170
Everyone, climb up quickly!

38
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,430
Watch for signs of sandworms

39
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,870
Safety

40
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,920
Turn on the shielding field!

41
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,480
There is no shielding field!

Where is the mouse running?

43
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,090
Never stand with your back to the enemy
Never stand with your back towards the opponent.

They don&#39;t usually go that deep.
They do not usually venture this deep.

50
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,730
They want to wipe out the Atreides.
They want to make sure no Atreides escaped.

51
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,690
You are too self-righteous
You think too much of yourself.

52
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,830
No, no, we are deep in the desert.

You may remember that the South is not a good place to live, sir.
As you may recall, the south is uninhabtable, my Lord

I need your guidance on how to deal with those two foreigners.

111
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,660
Leave them to the desert

112
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,630
I saw the signs

Others think I am a false prophet.

Then he is not Lisan Al-Gheb
Then he is not Lisan al-Gaib,

169
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,160
You won&#39;t have any meaning anymore.
And you have no purpose to serve.

This is a life or death decision
It was a choice between this or death,

175
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,290
So please forgive my disrespect
so forgive me if I&#39;m not flattered.

176
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,660
How does one become a Madonna?
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

177
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,830
Different cultures are different

Fatal to men
It&#39;s lethal for men.

186
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,190
Absolutely
That&#39;s for sure.

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,590
What are you laughing at?
What are you guys laughing about?

188

You don&#39;t believe in Lisan Al-Gheb?
You don&#39;t believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
Then they would wait for centuries.
Then they&#39;ll wait, for centuries.

201
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,530
Now we must pray
Now, we must pray.

206
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,630
What will happen to my mother?
What&#39;ll happen to my mother?

207
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,150
She drinks sandworm urine

208
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,550
It is not funny

209
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,220
He&#39;s going to lose her.

210
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,150
If she&#39;s stupid enough to drink poison

211
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,390
shut up! shut up!

212
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,030
We are praying

213
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,680
This is the water of life

214
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,620
It liberates the mind

215
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,990
If you drink

216
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,390
You will die

217
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,830
If you drink

218
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,970
You can see

220
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,670
What&#39;s this?

221
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,590
What did we do?

222
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,260
She is pregnant

223
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,670
That&#39;s not a miracle!

224
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,640
You saw it with your own eyes!

225
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,950

228
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,180
Just like it&#39;s written in the book!

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,090
That was written by her people!

230
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,990
Blasphemy

231
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,730
The prophecy has come true

232
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,530
The savior must be a Fremen!

233
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,030
Arrakis must be liberated by its own people!

She&#39;s right. She&#39;s right.
